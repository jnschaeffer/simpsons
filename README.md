# Sim(PSONs) -- Simpsons simulation

Sim(PSONs) is a domain-specific language for simulating agents in a persistent
environment. Agents are expressed as finite state machines with states defined
as programs that will run on given conditions, with transitions to new states
occurring when all conditions for entering a state are fulfilled.
